This repository contains the work I completed during my Web Development Internship at ApexPlanet, where I gained hands-on experience in building responsive websites, implementing front-end features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and collaborating on real-world projects.

## Task 1 - Basic Webpage  
In this task, I created a **basic webpage** using **HTML and CSS**.  
The project was focused on understanding the structure of a webpage, applying styles, and building a simple layout.  
### Key Highlights:
- Built with HTML & CSS  
- Simple and clean design  
- Introduced to fundamentals of web development
